# ArduinoAlarmClock
End goal = make alarm clock w/changable date and time on LCD and randomly chosen song clips as the alarm. The final version will use the LiquidCrystal and Wire libraries built into Arduino 1.8.9 as well as the DS3231 libary for the DS3231 clock module found at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27304043/detect-change-in-arduino-potentiometer.
